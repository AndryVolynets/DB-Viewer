# WPF, Databases, MVVM. Organizing Database Add-ons using WPF
The goal of the lab is to gain practical skills in creating procedures

* Implement the program interface using WPF.
* Implement 3 procedures with parameters for data viewing.
* Implement at least 3 procedures for data modification.
To improve the code structure and maintainability of the application, the MVVM pattern will be used. This pattern separates the application logic from the UI, improving testability and reusability of the code.

Additionally, the Singleton pattern will be implemented to ensure that only one instance of a class is created and used throughout the application, preventing multiple connections from being opened and causing conflicts. The Mediator pattern will also be used to facilitate communication between different parts of the application.

By utilizing these patterns, the WPF application will be structured in a way that promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability.

# Prerequisites
